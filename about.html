        <p>A travel agency is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism-related services to
          the general public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers to offer different kinds of travelling
          packages for each destination. Travel agencies can provide outdoor recreation activities, airlines, car
          rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, package tours, insurance, guide books, VIP airport
          lounge access, arranging logistics for luggage and medical items delivery for travellers upon request, public
          transport timetables, car rentals, and bureau de change services. Travel agencies can also serve as general
          sales agents for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency's main function is to
          act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. They do not keep inventory
          in-hand unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a
          wedding, honeymoon, or other group event.</p>

          <h2>Travel technology</h2>
          <p>Travel agencies use the services of the major computer reservations systems, also known as global
            distribution systems (GDS), including: Amadeus CRS, Galileo GDS, Sabre, and Worldspan, which is a subsidiary
            of Travelport, which allow for comparison and sorting of hotel and flight rates with multiple companies.
            Bookings made via travel agents, including online travel agents, may or may not be confirmed instantly.
            Unlike online travel agencies, metasearch engines and scraper sites, such as Skyscanner, Kayak.com,
            Rome2rio, and TripAdvisor, may or may not have their own booking engine, and instead provide results for
            search queries and then divert traffic to service providers or online travel agencies for booking.
            Travel agents may also work with airline consolidators. </p>

          <h2>Types of agencies</h2>
          <p>Booking Holdings and Expedia Group, both online travel agencies, are the largest travel agencies on the
            list of top earning travel companies.[11] Travel agencies can be multinational companies, referred to as
            "multiples" in the United Kingdom. They can also be medium-sized organizations, referred to as "miniples" in
            the United Kingdom, or can be independent, small companies. They can be structured as a limited liability
            company, a sole proprietorship, or can be set up as a host, franchising, or consortium structure, such as in
            the case of CWT. A traditional travel agent may work for a travel agency or work freelance.[12][13][14][15]
            Helloworld Travel is an example of a franchised travel agency, giving agents access to internal systems for
            product and bookings. </p>

          <h2>Outlook</h2>
          <p>According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2019, there were 82,000 people who worked as
            travel agents for their full-time jobs. That number is projected to decrease by 26% over the next 10 years.
            However, job prospects should be best for travel agents who specialize in specific destinations or
            particular types of travelers. In 2019, the median salary was $40,660 per year, compared to the median
            annual wage for all workers which was $39,810.Several reports show that the number of people using travel
            agents to book travel has been increasing</p>
